# Data-Structures-Project

## ADT’s
The two ADT’s I used were;
- Doubly Linked List
- ArrayList(s)
Reasoning:
For the project at hand, I believed any data structure would be fine to use since the
data set used could never amount to a lot. Searching, deleting and adding would not
differ much. So, I believe the DLL and AL were the simplest and best choice for my
project.
The DLL has;
- Dynamic memory allocation automates efficient memory usage.
- Fast inserts and deletions.
- Can traverse fast, due to having two pointers a head and tail. So, you can go
forwards and backwards through the list easily.
The ArrayList has;
- Dynamic resizing, unlike the static array where you must define its size before.
- Simple implementation, very easy to use and manipulate.
- Random access allows for shuffling playlists easily
## ADT Interfaces & Classes
I kept my interface(s) simple and separated for organization. The DLL has an interface
of its own and the ArrayLists share one interface together. Making two in total.
For the classes, I made as many as I thought would fulfil the brief. To have two
interfaces you must have a class the implements the methods of those interfaces.
- 2 interfaces with all the methods required.
- 2 classes to fulfil the methods of the interfaces.
- 1 class for the GUI that the user can use.
- 1 class for the node structure of the DLL.
- 1 main class to bring everything together.
